# Intro

I'm a 16 year old from Toronto making the most out of my short time here on Earth. I'm driven to solve problems and maximize impact, whether that be through reducing maternal mortality in Bolivia or enabling electricity access in rural Africa. I enjoy acquiring new skills and spend most of my time in from of my computer figuring out a new concept or engrossed by a good read.
